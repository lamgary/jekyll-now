This section contains notes from my personal learning.

Courses I have taken:
1. CS231n: my assignment solutions are posted [here](https://github.com/lamgary/cs231n_assignments)
2. Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Course: the lecture notes from [cs229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) are super helpful.
