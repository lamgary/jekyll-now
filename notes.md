I like to read up on various topics on Tech, this section contains notes from my reading.

It's mainly for my own benefit: forcing myself to write makes sure I check my understanding.

Snapshot of courses I have taken:
1. CS231n: my assignments from the 2017 Spring course are posted [here](https://github.com/lamgary/cs231n_assignments)
2. Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Course: I found the lecture notes from the actual [cs229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) course to be super helpful
